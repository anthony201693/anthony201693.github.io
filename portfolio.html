                Pew pew space edition is a game where you become one with a spaceship defending 
                <br>
                your life against a range of monsters. You have to survive as long as you can 
                <br>
                and kill all the enemies that are in your way.

                The scoring system that was in the game was the ammount to points you would gain by killing your enemies.
                <br>
                The randomness that was in the game is how the enemies would fall down the screen randomly.
                <br>
                The game gets harder over time due to bosses start spawning and the enemies spawn faster.
                <br> 
                This game is like a survival game; where people have to survire and keep killing. But there you can lose due to your three life points.
